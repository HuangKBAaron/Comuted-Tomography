# Comuted-Tomography
Biomedical Imaging Comuted Tomography algorithm
• CT scan algorithm was developed using Parallel computing in which attempt was made to reduce running time of algorithm . It was
implemented using Nvidia CUDA C/C++ and openCv library.
• It takes blocks of 7x7 pixels in blurry subject image and computes nearest matching block in some other clear CT scan images and
then replaces subject image block with respective CT Scan image block.
• This work will be submitted in International Conference for Image Processing 2017 for review purpose.
